> For this project, I looked at per capita CO2 emissions from food production and CO2 emissions overall by country.

> Input CO2 emissions data from food production can be found [here](https://github.com/KKulma/food-consumption-CO2emissions-shinyapp) and overall CO2 emissions data can be found [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC)
